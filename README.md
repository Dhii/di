## XedinUnknown - DI ##
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/XedinUnknown/di.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/XedinUnknown/di)

A demonstration of how it could be possible to formalize the delegate lookup feature
via a PHP interface, and at the same time not enforce a setter onto the implementation.

### Features
- Full working example of DI implementation;
- Standards-compliant;
- One interface with one method - all that you need to delegate;
- Lookup logic up to composite container implementation;
- Unlimited level of nesting.
